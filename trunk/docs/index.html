openADAMS is an Open Source "<u>A</u>rtifact <u>D</u>ocumentation <u>A</u>nd 
<u>M</u>anagement <u>S</u>ystem" to document and 
manage artifacts appearing in the software development process of a product, 
for instance <em>requirements</em>, <em>use cases</em> or <em>test cases</em>. 
</p>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>
Goal of this project is to provide a set of tools to manage some of the artifacts 
appearing in the software development process. Till now the term artifacts basically 
stands for <em>features</em>, <em>requirements</em>, <em>use cases</em>, 
<em>architecture and design documents</em>, 
and <em>test cases</em>.
</p>
<p>
Managing these artifacts of course means creating and editing them. 
Furthermore relations between artifacts could be organized.
</p>
<p>
The tools could be useful in small and medium sized development projects. 
Whenever you are used to write down requirements, use cases or test cases in a 
Word Processor or a Spreadsheet Software, you should consider using openADAMS instead.
</p>
<p>
openADAMS is a standalone desktop application, no database servers, web servers or similar 
are required.
</p>

openADAMS is the successor of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/afms/">AFMS</a>.

Here are the main new features of openADAMS:

<ul>
<li>
    Artifacts could  be organized in user definable folders
</li>
<li>
    Build in Rich Text Editor, no reStructured Text required any more
</li>
<li>
    Images could be stored in the Database and these images could be 
    inserted into Rich Text Fields of Artifacts
</li>
<li>
    Support for Architecture and Design documentation with new artifact 
    kind "components". Components have a Rich Text Field where you can 
    include things like UML Diagrams. Components may be related to requirements 
    to achieve traceability
</li>
<li>
    PyQt instead of wxPython for the GUI
</li>    
<li>
    Much more cleaner and smaller code. Thanks to Qt's model/view framework!
</li>    
</ul>

<p>
The test runner tool from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/afms/">AFMS</a> is
yet not available in openADAMS.
</p>
<p>
The NAFMS tools are implemented in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and 
uses <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a> for 
the graphical user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Artifacts and other data are stored in a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
database. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> (pysqlite) comes with current 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> releases.
